# binar-challenge-chapter-7

## This challenge is still far from perfect. It takes time for this code to run smoothly.
Features that are already working:
1. Passport local strategy authentication.
2. Restriction endpoint.
3. Get a token user from JWT.
4. Game logic and get value from the game to the database (game histories and game room)

## Features that are not working and need improvement:
1. Log in using the JWT token.
2. Connecting user id when making the game room.
3. Interface game.
4. Associate model
